## Status
This project is in its infancy. There is not much to see here. Come back later please. ;-)

## About
This project aims to provide an easy to follow tutorial for beginners to help setting up a homeserver with services like Nextcloud, Matrix and others. The ultimate goal would be a script to guide the administrator through all steps necessary.
